* Seeing false positives?
 - Periphery only analyzes files that are members of the targets you specify.
   References to declarations identified as unused may reside in files that are members of other targets, e.g test targets.
 - Periphery is a very precise tool, false positives often turn out to be correct after further investigation.
 - If it really is a false positive, please report it - https://github.com/peripheryapp/periphery/issues.
